# Connect 4 Game - Avocados Edition

## Analyze our App's Functionality

#### User Stories

User stories describe the features of your web application, in terms based on the user's point of view. 

As a user, I want this feature, because of this reason

MVP - Minimum Viable Product
The least amount of work required to release a prototype of our app

As a user...
- I want to be able to have 2 players
- I want to be able to take turns
- I want to alternate dropping colored 'discs' into 1 of 7 columns
- I want to be able to win once I get 4 of any one color in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally
- I want to see who has one(which player)
- I want to know if there is a tie
- I want to be able to play again after the game is over

**Bonus User Stories**
(these features would be nice to have if we have time to build them)
- Choosing who goes first
- Keep track of how many times each player won or lost (and ties)
  - maybe a scoreboard?
- I want to know maybe how many moves it took to win
- I want to be able to give up
- Maybe a timer, on the whole game or each move
- Choose the color of each player's discs

#### Think about the overall design(look and feel) of our app

- clean, minimalist design(layout)
- purple and orange for the discs
- Font: Raleway

## Wireframe the UI

- High Fidelity
  - Working demo
  - buttons are clickable
  - hover effects happen on those buttons
- Low Fidelity
  - drawing of the app
  - layout of the page(or pages)
  - Where is our header going?
  - Where are my buttons going?
  - Does this section feel crowded or empty?
